# My Research Portfolio

Research portfolio in polymer-based drug delivery, spectroscopy, enzyme biochemistry, and machine learning–driven modeling.

---
This repository serves as a consolidated portfolio of my research projects spanning polymer-based drug delivery, enzyme biochemistry, spectroscopy, and machine learning–driven modeling. The work integrates experimental characterization with data-driven methods to understand structure–property–performance relationships in biomedical and polymer systems.
